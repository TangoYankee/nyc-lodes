# Outline
- Changes to the topic
  - Shift from trying to predict changes in dynamics to instead focusing on how much of an impact each travel mode makes
- Changes to the timeline
  - Need to create a timeline
  - retroactively mark when progress has been made. Look forward to what progress still needs to be done.
- Review of the original timeline: 
  - more detailed information on what has changed for the project
- A more detailed version of the methods to be applied.

## Questions
- Edge effects?
- corrections for changes in census tracts
### Updated approach
- Network auto-correlation of OD desire lines for 2019 and 2002
- Network auto-correlation of MTA system
- Network auto-correlation of Highway system
- Regression to compare the MTA and Highway systems, to see which has the greatest effect
- Is there are way to measure the shift in the networks?
